# Glassdoor-Jobs-analysis
We came up with this personal personal project to test my skills to the fullest and learn new things. In this project, I scraped job postings related to the position of 'Data Scientist' from glassdoor.com, analyzed the gathered data, and framed a machine learning problem out of it. In the below write I'll mention the details on what I learned. I selected the states of California, Washington, and New York as major areas to find the roles.

Glassdoor is a website where current and former employees anonymously review companies. Glassdoor also allows users to anonymously submit and view salaries as well as search and apply for jobs on its platform.Glassdoor launched its site in 2008 , as a site that “collects company reviews and real salaries from employees of large companies and displays them anonymously for all members to see,” according to TechCrunch. The company then averaged the reported salaries, posting these averages alongside the reviews employees made of the management and culture of the companies they worked for—including some of the larger tech companies like Google and Yahoo. The site also allows the posting of office photographs and other company-relevant media
